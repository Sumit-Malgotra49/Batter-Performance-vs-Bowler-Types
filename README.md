**🏏 Cricket Analytics Project: Batter Performance vs Bowler Types**
📊 Overview
This project focuses on cricket analytics using Python and Excel. It aims to provide insights into how batters perform against different types of bowlers using real-world match data. The analysis is structured progressively — from a general overview to granular player-specific insights — and concludes with a visual dashboard built in Excel for easy interpretation.

**🔍 Problem Statement**
In modern cricket, match-ups between batters and bowlers play a key role in strategic decisions. This project explores:

How batters perform against different types of bowlers (e.g., pace, spin, left-arm orthodox, etc.)

How individual players fare when facing each bowling style

Identifying strengths and weaknesses based on historical data

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn for optional visuals)

Excel (Dashboard Creation)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code for scripting
